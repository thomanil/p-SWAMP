"""``DataClient``: the contract a data source implements.

A client is **one source**, of one of two kinds:

- ``history``: holds a range of records (a recording, a store). ``coverage``
  says which; ``consume`` yields the records in a requested range and stops.
  The player replays it, and can seek.
- ``live``: a feed. ``coverage`` is ``None``; ``consume`` yields records as
  they arrive, from now, until the range's end or for ever.

``consume`` must yield ``model`` records with UTC timestamps, in timestamp
order, inside the requested range; closing the iterator early must release
whatever it holds. ``pswamp_core.testing.DataClientConformance`` checks all of
this.

A client imports only ``pswamp_core``, so a deployment can write its own
outside this repo. It is configured from the environment like any
``Configurable``: it declares ``env_settings``, and ``from_env(name)`` reads
``{NAME}_{SETTING}``.
