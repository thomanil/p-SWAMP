"""Falling behind, noticed and reported: ``KeepUp`` and ``KeepUpMonitor``.

A module reads a bounded ``DROP_OLDEST`` queue: right for a live stream, and
silent unless someone counts. Every message that crossed a transport carries
when it was sent (``messages.sent_at``). The monitor watches both, dropped
input and input age, and past a ``KeepUp`` policy publishes an ``ErrorEvent``:
once on falling behind, at most every ``report_every_s`` while behind, and once
on catching up. So it reaches the error tray, not only the log. The run's
outbox reports the same way when it has to drop what it cannot publish.
