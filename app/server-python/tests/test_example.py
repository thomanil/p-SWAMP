"""A minimal example test — the shape to copy for a new server unit test.

It shows the two things every suite here needs and nothing else: how to import a
server package under ``src/`` by name (``pythonpath = ["src"]`` in
``pyproject.toml`` puts it on the path, same as the running server), and a plain
``assert``. Run the whole suite with ``./scripts/run-python-server-tests.sh``, or
just this file with ``./scripts/run-python-server-tests.sh tests/test_example.py``.

The function under test, ``wire.sample``, is a good first example because it is
pure and hermetic — no event loop, no Hub, no socket — and it enforces the wire
format's "NaN is null" rule (see the module docstring in ``pswamp_web/wire.py``).
