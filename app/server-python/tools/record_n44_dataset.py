"""Record a Nordic 44 PMU stream to a replayable dataset.

Run once, by hand, to produce the artifact the server replays. It needs the
simulator, which lives in p-SWAMP's ``[full]`` extra and is therefore *not* in
this project's environment -- so run it with the sibling checkout's interpreter,
pointed at this source tree:

    PYTHONPATH=app/server-python/src \
      ../p-SWAMP/.venv/bin/python app/server-python/tools/record_n44_dataset.py

Nothing that *consumes* a recording needs any of that: the server reads the
resulting .npz with numpy alone.

What is recorded are decoded rows -- the ``(time, measurements)`` an application
sees after ``PMUDecoder`` -- rather than raw C37.118 frames. The frames are
produced by the real ``SimplePMU`` and decoded by the real ``PMUDecoder``, so
the rows are identical to what the live path yields, but replaying them needs
neither the C37.118 implementation nor the per-frame decoding cost.

The scenario is the one from ``tests/monitoring/test_islanding.py``: four lines
trip at t=20 s and reconnect at t=40 s, splitting the northern part of the grid
into its own frequency island. That disturbance is the point of the recording,
so :func:`verify` re-runs the real islanding detector over the finished data and
refuses to write a file that does not reproduce it.
