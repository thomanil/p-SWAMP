"""Write the api contract to a file. Driven by scripts/generate-api-contract.sh.

    python tools/dump_openapi.py <output.json>

Imports the FastAPI app and asks it for its own document, so the committed
contract is by construction the same one the running server serves at
/openapi.json -- there is no second description of the api to keep in step.

Importing `server` needs src/ on the path but NOT the working directory to be
src/, which is why that is arranged here rather than in the shell script. The
import is cheap: it binds no port, starts no threads, and does not touch the
recorded PMU dataset -- `replay.load_recording` is `lru_cache`d and lazy, so the
first pipeline pays for it, not this. Measured ~0.2 s to import and ~0.02 s to
build the document. The Dockerfile already does `python -c "import server"` as a
build smoke test, so this is a well-trodden path.

Output is pretty-printed with sorted keys. Both matter: this file is committed and
read in review, so the diff for a changed endpoint should be the endpoint, not a
reshuffle of unrelated keys.
