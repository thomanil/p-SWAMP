"""Drive the Reference example app end to end. Driven by scripts/smoketest.sh.

    python tools/smoketest_reference_subapp.py <base-url>

This is the manual smoke test written down: open the socket, fire the REST
commands, and check that the counter coming back down the socket ends up where a
person clicking the buttons would expect it. Doing that proves routing, the
client id, the command path, the push path and the per-client state are all still
wired together -- which is why the Reference example is the app worth automating
rather than a p-SWAMP page.

It lives here rather than in the shell script because a WebSocket is the one part
bash has no way to speak. No new dependency: `websockets` is already in the
server's locked environment, pulled in by uvicorn[standard], and the POSTs go
through urllib, so this runs in the same `uv run --project app/server-python`
environment the api contract is generated in.

Deliberately NOT a browser test. It exercises the wire, not the UI -- nothing here
would notice a button that stopped calling its command. That is the gap a
Playwright test would close later; this closes the larger one first, at a fraction
of the cost.

Exits 0 if every step passed, 1 otherwise. Every step is reported, pass or fail,
so one run tells you everything that is broken rather than only the first thing.
