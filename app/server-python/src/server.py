"""The one process entrypoint: assembles the app and routes to the app packages.

This module deliberately owns no domain logic. It does four things:

  1. mounts each app package's router under its own /api/<slug> prefix (APPS below),
  2. composes their lifespans into the single FastAPI lifespan,
  3. serves GET /healthz, the cheap liveness probe for Docker/k8s,
  4. serves the web client (the Vite build in static/) at / — same app, port, and
     origin as the api, so one image and one Service serve both.

Each app under src/<app>/ is a self-contained package exposing `router`, and
optionally `WS_MESSAGE` and `lifespan` (see src/reference_subapp/__init__.py).
Adding a backend api is one new package plus one entry in APPS; nothing else in
this file changes.

The server is entirely stateless in the persistence sense: there is no database
and nothing is written to disk. All state lives in the app packages' memory and is
gone when the process exits — a restart or redeploy resets every client.

Bind host/port come from the HOST/PORT env vars (default 127.0.0.1:8000) so the
container can publish on 0.0.0.0 without code changes; see Dockerfile.

# before any app package handles a request. Entered before everything in APPS and
# exited after it, so a websocket handler can assume its dependencies are up.
#
# pswamp_web is the one: it owns the registry of per-client PMU pipelines that
# its page packages all draw theirs from. Its lifespan starts no pipeline — those
# are built on a client's first connect and evicted when idle — it only binds the

#
# One AppEntry per backend api: its url slug, the package that serves it, and one
# line saying what it is (which becomes the group heading in /docs).
#
# The slug is the single spelling of an app's name. It is the url segment — the
# router is mounted at /api/<slug>, so the streamer's own "/ws" is served as
# /api/pmu-test-streamer/ws and several apps can each have a "ws" without
# colliding — and it is also the web client's route for the same app, so the two
# halves read the same. The package name is that word with underscores, which is
# a Python identifier requirement rather than a choice: pmu_test_streamer →
# /api/pmu-test-streamer.
#
# src/shared.py is NOT an app package and never appears here — it holds the
# domain-free helpers the packages import (see its docstring).

# In the shipped image the web client is served from this same origin, so none of
# this applies. In local dev it is not: the client runs on the Vite dev server
# and talks to this process on another port.
#
# That was invisible for as long as the client only opened WebSockets, which are
# not subject to the same-origin policy. The moment a page fetched something over
# plain HTTP — the grid topology, the channel catalogue — the browser began
# silently discarding the responses, and the affected component sat waiting for
# data that had in fact arrived.
#
# Wide open, and it now needs a fuller justification than it did: this server no
# longer only reads. Every operator action -- play, pause, pick a channel,
# acknowledge an alarm -- is a POST under /api/<app>/, so a page on any origin can
# drive a client's replay if it knows that client's id.
#
# It stays open anyway, deliberately, because of what those mutations actually
# touch: a per-client replay of a committed sample recording, with no auth, no
# secrets, and nothing persisted -- a reload of the page undoes any of it. The
# client id is not a credential and the server says so (see hub.read_client_id).
#
# What WOULD change this: anything real behind an endpoint. Live PMU data, a
# store that outlives the process, or any notion of a user. Narrow it to the dev
# origins then, and note that nothing here depends on the wildcard today -- both
# dev (through the Vite proxy) and production (served by this process) are
# same-origin, so CORS is not exercised at all.

# mount is guarded on the dir existing so the api-only paths still boot without it
# — i.e. `uv run src/server.py` from app/server-python/ for quick backend dev (the
# web client is run separately with hot reload via
# scripts/start-local-hotloaded-pswamp-web-client.sh). It's registered AFTER
# /healthz and the routers above because a mount at "/" is greedy and would shadow
# them — so must any api route added later.

    (and a hard refresh / deep link onto one) resolve to the SPA shell instead of
    404ing. Requests for real files — hashed assets, favicon — still hit those
    first.

    Two prefixes keep their real 404 instead of the shell: a missing file under
    assets/ (a bad hashed-asset URL should fail loudly, not return HTML with the
    wrong content type) and anything under api/ (a wrong or removed endpoint must
    look wrong to a JSON caller, and an api 404 is never a navigation route).
    Everything else, i.e. the client's own routes, falls through to the shell.

    It also sets Cache-Control, which StaticFiles does not. Without it a browser
    may apply heuristic freshness and serve the shell from cache unvalidated —
    and since asset filenames are content-hashed, a cached shell pins the previous
    build's assets, so the whole old client is reassembled from cache with no
    requests made. The deploy looks stale when it isn't. Only the shipped image
    is affected; Vite's dev server sends no-cache itself.

    So: the shell is a mutable name and must revalidate (`no-cache` means "ask
    first", not "don't store" — the ETag makes that a 304); everything under
