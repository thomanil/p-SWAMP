"""Loop-side state built from what the application threads publish.

p-SWAMP has equivalents of both of these -- ``coordination.AlarmMonitor`` and
``gui.app_monitoring.AppStatusMonitoring`` -- but in both the useful logic sits
inside a ``for message in consumer:`` loop over a Kafka topic, so neither can be
reused without a broker. What is reimplemented here is only the state machine
part; the shapes match, so folding these back into upstream as the pure half of
those classes is mechanical.
