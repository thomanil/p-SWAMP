"""The wire format between the p-SWAMP analysis core and a browser.

p-SWAMP's Qt front end never needed one of these: its widgets hold a reference to
the very ``TimeWindow`` object the application thread is writing into, and read it
on a repaint timer. Nothing is ever serialised, so nothing ever had to have a
schema. The one place a message does cross a process boundary -- the streaming
layer -- pickles Python objects inside a JSON envelope, which no browser can read.

So this module is where the shapes get named. Every message a page receives is
declared here, and every page sends through :func:`send_state`.

It also holds the names every REST command endpoint declares itself with --
:data:`ClientId`, :class:`CommandAck`, :func:`read_client_id` -- for the whole
backend, not just this package. They live here rather than in ``src/shared.py``
because the import may only run one way: this package is written to move into the
desktop package as ``pswamp/web/``, so nothing in it may import from the rest of
the web backend, while ``shared.py`` importing *inward* costs nothing and stays
legal after the move. It re-exports them for the app packages beside it.

Two conventions worth knowing before adding a message:

**snake_case on the wire, and on the screen.** The web client reads these field
names as they are, through the types generated from this module -- there is no
renaming layer, because one that has to be extended by hand for every new field
is one that silently drops the fields nobody remembered.

**NaN is null.** Not a formality: ``json.dumps`` emits a bare ``NaN`` token,
which ``JSON.parse`` rejects outright, and NaN is the *normal* case here -- a
``TimeWindow`` is all-NaN until it fills, and the PMU decoder substitutes NaN for
missing frequencies. Without this the very first message to every page would be a
parse error in the browser. ``null`` is also what a charting library wants to see
for a gap, so nothing is lost on the way in.
