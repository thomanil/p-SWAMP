"""Line outage detection.

The web counterpart of p-SWAMP's ``LineOutageDetectionApp``, which watches the
current magnitude on every branch and reports the moment one stops carrying
current. The detector itself is upstream and unmodified; everything here is
transport.

Event-driven, and more so than islanding: ``run_analysis`` returns ``None``
unless a branch actually changed state, so a healthy grid produces no traffic at
all. There is nothing to poll and no ticker -- the client is sent the log on
connect, and again whenever it grows.

Note this application is the reason the recorded dataset carries current
channels. It reads ``i_Magnitude``, which the frequency- and voltage-based
applications ignore; a recording made without those channels leaves this
detector running happily and finding nothing, forever.
