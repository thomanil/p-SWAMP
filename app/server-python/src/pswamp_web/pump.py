"""Serving one downstream socket: the part every page endpoint had written out.

A page endpoint is three things — identify the client and get its pipeline, decide
what to send, and then run the socket. The first is :func:`..hub.connected_hub`.
This module is the third, so that what is left in a page package is the second,
which is the only part that differs.

What it replaces: five endpoints that each ended in the same fifteen lines —
create a pusher task, sit in ``while True: await ws.receive_text()``, swallow the
disconnect, cancel the task and suppress its ``CancelledError``. Identical in all
five, which meant a fix to any of it was a fix in five places, and a sixth page
would have been a sixth copy.

Two shapes of page, and both are here:

* **Ticker-driven** — :func:`serve_ticks`. Read the client's window on a timer and
  send what is there. Used where there is nothing to react to: a measurement
  stream (``time_window``, ``phasors``) or a table whose interesting case is
  something *not* arriving (``app_status``, where "stale" is the absence of a
  report). This is the direct translation of what the Qt widgets do, and it is
  what keeps a 50 Hz sample stream from becoming 50 event-loop callbacks a second.
* **Event-driven** — :func:`event_queue` + :func:`serve_updates`. Wake on the
  client's own bus and send when there is something to send. Used for results and
  alarms (``islanding``, ``line_outage``), which arrive about once a second, or
  not at all while the grid is healthy.

Both end in :func:`wait_for_disconnect`, which the scaffold apps under ``src/``
use directly through ``shared.py`` — they have no pusher of their own, but they
need the same receive loop for the same reason.
