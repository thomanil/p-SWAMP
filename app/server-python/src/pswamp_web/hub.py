"""One PMU pipeline per client, and the registry that owns their lifecycle.

Each connected client gets its **own** replay of the recording, starting at 0 s
when it first connects, with its own player, its own application threads and its
own alarm/status/island stores. Nothing about the grid data is shared between
clients any more except the recording itself, which is read-only.

That is a reversal of what this module used to do, and the reasoning is worth
keeping. The earlier arrangement ran one pipeline for the whole process, on the
grounds that there is one grid and two operators seeing different frequencies
would be a bug. True of a control room; false of this, which is a rig for
exploring recorded data. A visitor wants to watch the disturbance from the
beginning, not join someone else's replay half way through — so the useful unit
is one timeline per viewer.

The invariant is therefore now simply: **everything is per client.** The page
packages' ``ClientState`` still holds view state (which channels are selected,
what was last sent); the Hub beside it holds that client's data.

What that costs, and why the registry is not optional: a Hub is **four threads**
and roughly 30 MB of resident memory, and freed memory is not returned to the OS,
so peak RSS follows the *cap* rather than the typical load. Hence
:class:`HubRegistry` — it bounds how many exist, reclaims them when nobody is
watching, and is the only thing allowed to construct one.

    * **A pipeline outlives its sockets, briefly.** Closing the last one starts
      an idle timer rather than tearing down, so a reload rejoins the same
      stream. Reconnecting cancels the timer.
    * **Never more than the cap.** At the cap a new client reclaims the
      least-recently-used pipeline that nobody is watching; if every one is in
      use, the connection is refused rather than the machine oversubscribed.

    Two refusals, and the ordering of ``accept`` between them is the point:

    * **No usable client id** -- closed before accepting, i.e. the handshake is
      rejected outright. Our own client always sends one, so this is a caller
      that has no business here.
    * **At capacity** -- accepted *first*, then closed with 1013, because a code
      only reaches the browser on an established connection. The web client
      treats 1013 as terminal and stops reconnecting, which is the whole reason
      to spend a handshake on saying no politely.
