"""The Reference example app's backend.

WebSocket api, per-client state, REST commands — here a placeholder counter, one
per client. Replace it with what this app really does, keeping the shape.

Commands come up over REST and state goes down over the socket; the reasoning is
in AGENTS.md and doc/the-client-server-api.md.

server.py mounts this `router` under this app's /api/<app> prefix — here
/api/reference-subapp — so the paths below carry no prefix of their own.

All state is in memory and dies with the process, and everything runs on the one
asyncio event loop, so no locking is needed.
