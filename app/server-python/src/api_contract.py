"""The published api contract: document metadata, and the socket half of it.

`server.py` mounts the apps; this module describes them. It is deliberately not
an app package -- it exposes no `router`, never appears in `APPS`, and holds no
domain logic -- so it sits beside `shared.py` rather than under it.

Why this exists
==

FastAPI already describes the *upstream* half of the api for free: every command
is a POST with an explicit `operation_id`, a pydantic body and a `CommandAck`
reply, so `/openapi.json` has always listed them. The *downstream* half was
invisible, because OpenAPI describes HTTP operations and every byte of state in
this system arrives over a WebSocket. The message models existed -- they are the
whole of `pswamp_web/wire.py` -- they were simply never published, so the web
client hand-maintained a TypeScript mirror of each one and a renamed field failed
at runtime rather than in any check.

This module closes that gap without a second spec format. It merges the socket
message schemas into `components.schemas` and records which channel carries which
under a vendor extension, so one document describes both directions and one
generator turns it into TypeScript.

How a package joins the contract
==

By exporting a name. `server.py` already discovers optional package features with
`getattr(module, "lifespan", None)`; socket messages work the same way::

    # pmu_test_streamer/__init__.py
    WS_MESSAGE = PmuStreamState

`ws_channels` walks the very `APPS` list `server.py` mounts and picks up whatever
each package exports under that name. There is no second registry to keep in
step, and `scripts/generate-new-subapp.sh` needs no extra anchor to patch -- a
scaffolded subapp is in the contract the moment it is generated, because its
template exports the name. An app with no socket (`pswamp_web/grid/`, which is
HTTP only) simply omits it.

Discovery by `getattr` has one failure mode, and `check_apps` closes it: an app
that serves a WebSocket and forgets the export used to drop out of the document
in silence. It now refuses to start.

The vendor extension
==

Channels land at the document root as `x-websocket-channels`::

    {"path": "/api/time-window/ws", "app": "time-window",
     "direction": "server-to-client",
     "message": {"$ref": "#/components/schemas/TimeWindowSlice"}}

An extension rather than AsyncAPI, deliberately: a second spec format would mean
a second generator, a second drift check and a second thing for another team to
learn, to describe seven one-way channels. `x-` keys are legal OpenAPI and every
generator ignores what it does not know, so the document stays valid and the
schemas -- which is what codegen actually consumes -- come through as ordinary
`components.schemas` entries.

API_DESCRIPTION = """\
The api between the p-SWAMP web client and its state server.

**Two directions, two transports.** Anything a user triggers goes up as an HTTP
`POST` under `/api/<app>/`; everything the server has to say comes down a
WebSocket at `/api/<app>/ws`, which is downstream only. A command's reply is a
small `CommandAck`, never state, so state has exactly one path and there is no
ordering to reconcile between two of them.

**The operations below are therefore only half the api.** The socket half is
described by the `x-websocket-channels` extension at the root of this document,
whose message schemas are ordinary `components.schemas` entries — so a code
generator picks them up like any other model even though OpenAPI itself has no
notion of a socket.

**The first path segment after `/api/` is the routing key.** The server itself
holds no domain logic: it mounts one self-contained backend package under each
`/api/<app>` prefix, so `/api/pmu-test-streamer/...` is served by
`src/pmu_test_streamer/`, `/api/time-window/...` by
`src/pswamp_web/time_window/`, and so on for every tag listed below — the paths
a package declares are relative to its own prefix.
`/healthz` sits outside `/api` because it is the process's health rather than any
one app's, and everything else is the built web client, served from the same
origin with unknown paths falling back to its `index.html` so deep links work.

**Every request carries `?client_id=`**, a numeric string the browser resolves
once per profile and persists. It is the sharding key for all server state and
all of a browser's sockets must send the same one. It is *not* authentication and
does not pretend to be: supply someone else's id and you drive their session.

**The web client's types are generated from api contract** `openapi-typescript` 
compiles it into `app/client-web/src/api/schema.ts`,
which is commited in git, and a page hook takes its
downstream type from there rather than hand-copying the Python model's fields —
`Wire['ReferenceSubappState']` for `/api/reference-subapp/ws`. Field names stay as
the server sends them, snake_case and all, all the way to the frontend components.

This document is generated from the server and committed at `doc/api/openapi.json`;
`scripts/error_check.sh` fails if the two disagree. See
`doc/the-client-server-api.md` for more detail.
