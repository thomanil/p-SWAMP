// Where the web client's requests point: always the origin the page was served
// from. There is no backend picker and no address table.
//
// Two kinds of address live here, because the two directions use two transports.
// State comes *down* over a WebSocket (the `*_WS_PATH` consts); commands go *up*
// as POSTs (the `*_API_PATH` consts, which are the app's prefix — each endpoint
// appends its own path). Both resolve against the same origin by the same rule.
//
// That one rule covers both ways this app runs, because dev is made to look like
// production rather than special-cased:
//
//   - shipped build — the client is *served by* the backend (container, minikube
//     NodePort, any remote cluster), so its own origin already is the backend.
//   - `npm run dev` — the page's origin is the Vite dev server, whose proxy
//     forwards the whole /api prefix (WebSocket upgrades included) to the local
//     docker server on :8000. See `server.proxy` in vite.config.ts.
//
// So aiming dev at a different backend is a proxy-target edit in vite.config.ts,
// not a runtime choice in the UI.

// own /api/<app> prefix (see APPS in app/server-python/src/server.py), so these

// than a literal repeated across the hooks that connect.
