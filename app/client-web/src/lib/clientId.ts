// Who this browser is, as far as the server is concerned.
//
// One id per browser profile, persisted in localStorage and resolved once at
// module load. Two properties follow from that, and the app depends on both:
//
//   1. **Every socket in the page shares it.** The server keeps one PMU pipeline
//      per client id, and the grid monitor opens five sockets at once — so an id
//      rolled per hook (which is what this replaced) would ask for five separate
//      pipelines per browser, each with its own replay and its own four threads.
//   2. **It survives a reload.** A remount, a navigation, a hard refresh and a
//      crashed tab all come back to the same id, and therefore rejoin the same
//      stream rather than starting a new one at 0 s.
//
// Note the scope is the *origin*, not the tab: two tabs on the same profile are
// one client and watch the same replay. That is the intended reading of "come
// back to their own stream" — a person, not a window.
//
// Deliberately a plain random integer rather than a UUID: the scaffold demo
// (/api/pmu-test-streamer) parses this same parameter with int() and closes the
// socket with 1008 on anything else. It is not a secret and not
// authentication — the server says as much — so randomness only has to avoid
// collisions between colleagues, not resist guessing.
