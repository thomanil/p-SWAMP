/**
 * The grid view's two projections, as plain functions over plain numbers.
 *
 * The cameras take the very parameters the Qt grid view sets on its pyqtgraph
 * `GLViewWidget`, so "the same view" is a matter of copying four numbers.
 *
 * The picture is drawn by WebGL, which projects for itself. These are the same
 * projections done on the CPU, for everything that has to know where a point
 * lands without drawing it: fitting the opening view, finding the bus under the
 * pointer, and placing the bus names on the canvas laid over the picture.
 * `glPainter.ts` stands its GL camera exactly where these say the view is from.
 *
 * World space is the Qt view's: x is longitude, y is latitude times the
 * diagram's aspect ratio, z is height above the map.
