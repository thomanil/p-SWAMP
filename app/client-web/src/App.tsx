/**
 * The route table — the one place that knows which apps this client hosts.
 *
 * An app is a folder under `src/pages/<app>/`. Most own a single route; the grid
 * monitor owns several, because its panels are views of one server-side timeline
 * that are useful both together (the dashboard at `/`) and one at a time (the
 * focused routes below, which render the *same* panel components with
 * variant="focused" rather than copies of them).
 *
 * Deep links and hard refreshes work in both modes: Vite's dev server and the
 * Python server's SPAStaticFiles both fall back to index.html on an unknown
 * path. Because that fallback catches *any* such path, the `*` route below is
 * what keeps a typo'd URL from rendering the nav over an empty outlet.
 *
 * `basename` is what makes every route below relative to wherever the app is
 * mounted — `/` locally, `/p-swamp` behind the remote reverse
 * proxy — so the paths here (and every `<NavLink to>` / `<Navigate to>`) stay
 * written as if the app owned the origin root. BASE_PATH is discovered at
 * runtime, not configured; see src/lib/basePath.ts.
