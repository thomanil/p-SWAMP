# agrees with the client perfectly — both are equally behind the Python, and tsc
# only compares TypeScript to TypeScript. So the image builds clean and the pod
# serves a client expecting fields the server no longer sends. Regenerating and
# diffing is the only thing that notices.

# deploying a WIP contract, not for getting past a red check.
