# Run the Python state server's unit test suite (app/server-python/tests/).
#
# The stable interface for those tests: it hides the `uv run --project … pytest`
# incantation and the working-directory rule pytest needs to find its config.
#
# Every file under app/server-python/tests/ is picked up automatically — pytest
# discovers test_*.py and testpaths=["tests"] is set in
# app/server-python/pyproject.toml — so a suite added there needs no change here.
#
# These are fast and hermetic: HubRegistry is driven with a stubbed Hub, so
# nothing binds a port and no server starts. They are deliberately NOT part of
# scripts/error_check.sh, which is strictly static (lockfile / AST / lint / api
# contract) and runs no test suites.
#
# The desktop "core" package's tests (repo-root tests/) are a separate suite in a
# separate env — see scripts/run-core-python-tests.sh.
#
# Any arguments are forwarded verbatim to pytest:
#   ./scripts/run-python-server-tests.sh                 # the whole suite
#   ./scripts/run-python-server-tests.sh -v              # verbose
#   ./scripts/run-python-server-tests.sh -k lock         # tests whose name matches "lock"
#   ./scripts/run-python-server-tests.sh tests/test_hub_registry.py::test_new_client_refused_when_all_slots_in_use
#
# Must run on bash 3.2 (macOS's /bin/bash), so no bash-4 builtins here.
