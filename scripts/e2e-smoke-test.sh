#   scripts/e2e-smoke-test.sh                                 build a server, test it, stop it
#   SMOKETEST_URL=http://host:port scripts/e2e-smoke-test.sh  test a server already running
#
# The first form ALWAYS starts from scratch (every p-swamp container removed,
# image rebuilt, container recreated) — a reused server is not the tree you are
# testing; see teardown_pswamp for the three ways that has bitten. The second form
# touches nothing: the caller owns that server (the path CI takes).
#
# This is the manual test automated: the click-through of the Reference example
# that proves routing, the socket, the client id, a POST command and per-client
# state all still hold. It's the Reference example, not a p-SWAMP page, because
# that app is the stable path through the whole stack (AGENTS.md) — so a failure
# here is a broken rig, not a changed feature.
#
# Complements error_check.sh: that one never starts the app, this only starts it.
# Run both. It exercises the WIRE only, and would not notice a dead button or a
# blank panel; a Playwright browser test is the intended next layer on top.
#
# Checks, in order:
#   1. /healthz answers                — the process is serving
#   2. / serves the built web client   — the client is baked into the image
#   3. a deep link serves the shell    — SPAStaticFiles' history fallback
#   4. a missing asset still 404s      — that fallback isn't swallowing everything
#   5. /openapi.json has the commands  — the api describes itself
#   6. the counter flow                — POST commands in, state down the socket
#
# Steps 1-5 are curl; step 6 is tools/smoketest_reference_subapp.py, since bash
# can't speak a WebSocket (websockets is already in the server's env via
# uvicorn[standard]). Every step runs even if one fails; exits non-zero if any did.
