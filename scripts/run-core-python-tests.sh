# Run the desktop "core" p-swamp package's test suite (repo-root tests/).
#
# Separate from the server tests (scripts/run-python-server-tests.sh) on purpose:
# a different Python project (the ROOT pyproject.toml + uv.lock, the pswamp
# package), resolved in a different env, and a very different kind of test.
#
# ── STARTING POINT — read before wiring this anywhere automated ──────────────
# Unlike the server suite, the core suite is NOT hermetic. Most files under
# tests/ need the desktop [full] extra (PySide6, kafka-python, nqkafka, tops-rt,
# paho-mqtt, …) AND external infrastructure at run time — a Kafka broker, an
# NQKafka / MQTT broker, a Qt display — and they carry no skip guards, so without
# that infra they ERROR rather than skip.

# The obvious next step for this stub is to mark the infra-bound tests (pytest
# markers or importorskip) so a bare run executes the hermetic subset and skips
# the rest, instead of failing. Until then, expect failures on a bare machine.

# Runs in the root project's [full] env, which also carries pytest (via

#   ./scripts/run-core-python-tests.sh -k geo                  # a subset by name
#   ./scripts/run-core-python-tests.sh tests/monitoring -v     # one area, verbose
#
# Must run on bash 3.2 (macOS's /bin/bash), so no bash-4 builtins here.
