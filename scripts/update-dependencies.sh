# Pull every dependency forward to the newest version its range allows, then hand
# you the diff to review. Staying near the head is cheap supply-chain defence — a
# boring monthly upgrade instead of one scary 400-package jump a year.
#
# It DECIDES nothing — it produces a candidate diff:
#   1. run on a branch,
#   2. read the "What actually moved" report (a lockfile diff is ~95% sha256
#      hashes; the report prints the versions), then the manifests, hard on any
#      major jump,
#   3. run the app and click through it,
#   4. open a PR, so someone else sees the same diff.
# It edits four manifests + three lockfiles in place and nothing else. Never
# commit the result unread — the reading is the whole point.
#
# WHAT IT TOUCHES
#   Web client (app/client-web)
#     - npm-check-updates -u   rewrite package.json ranges to newest (the step
#                              `npm update` won't do). --peer skips a bump no
#                              installed peerDependency accepts, and reports it.
#     - npm install            re-resolve package-lock.json; falls back to a
#                              from-scratch resolve on ERESOLVE (see that step).
#   Desktop package (root) + Web backend (app/server-python)
#     - uv lock --upgrade      re-resolve each closure. The backend re-reads the
#                              p-swamp path dependency (--upgrade implies
#                              --refresh; a plain `uv lock` doesn't — see
#                              AGENTS.md), so it's locked AFTER the root.
#
# It does NOT widen a Python range: `uv lock --upgrade` respects pyproject.toml's
# bounds and uv has no npm-check-updates, so a cap like `fastapi>=…,<0.116` needs
# a hand edit. The report lists exactly which direct deps are held back and how
# far they could go.
