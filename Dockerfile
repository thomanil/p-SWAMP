# --- web client build stage -------------------------------------------------
#
# Build the Vite/React/TS web client to plain static files. A pinned Node image
# runs `npm ci` + `vite build`, emitting /web/dist (index.html + favicon/icons +
# hashed files under assets/). Only that dist/ is copied into the final image —
# Node and node_modules never ship. Pinned to a digest for reproducible builds
# (the tag is kept as documentation); this is the multi-arch index digest, so
# arm64/amd64 both resolve. Resolved 2026-06-06 from tag 22-bookworm-slim.

# So with the server at /app, "../../" would be unresolvable and the manifest
# would need a second, image-only variant. Keeping the repo's own depth means one
# literal path string is correct both on a development machine and here.

# The root manifest, and only the manifest, before the dependency install.
# p-swamp is an editable path dependency, and uv insists on generating its
# package metadata while resolving -- even with --no-emit-package below, which
# only suppresses it from the *output*. So the root project has to exist here,
# but nothing of it is needed yet except what declares its metadata (README.md
# comes along because the root manifest's `readme =` points at it, and uv reads
# it to build the metadata). Copying those two files rather than the whole tree
# is what keeps the expensive wheel install below on a layer that a change to
# root src/pswamp/ does not invalidate.
COPY pyproject.toml README.md ${REPO_DIR}/

# pyproject.toml declares the direct dependencies; uv.lock pins the whole
# transitive closure resolved from it. Install system-wide at build time, so
# container startup needs no network and no runtime resolution.
#
# --locked asserts the lockfile exists and still matches pyproject.toml: change a
# dependency without re-running `uv lock`, or forget to COPY the lock, and the
# build fails loudly here instead of silently re-resolving to whatever the index
# serves today. --no-emit-project skips this non-packaged project itself, and
# --no-dev keeps the linter out of the image. Hashes are kept (no --no-hashes),
# so uv verifies every artifact it installs; the lock carries wheel hashes for
# both amd64 and arm64, so this stays multi-arch.
#
# --no-emit-package p-swamp excludes the root project itself, which is a path
# dependency rather than something to fetch from an index; it is installed from
# its own layer below. Its third-party requirements (numpy, scipy, pandas) are
# still emitted here, so they stay in this cached, hash-verified layer.
#
# synchrophasor is excluded deliberately. It is p-SWAMP's C37.118 implementation,
# declared as one of its dependencies but imported only by the live-PMU and
# playback paths -- neither of which this server uses, since it replays an
# already-decoded recording. It is also the one dependency fetched from git
# rather than an index, so keeping it out means this image needs no git, no
# network access to GitHub, and no hashless VCS pin sitting among otherwise
# fully hash-verified packages. The import check after the source copy below is
# what keeps that a checked decision rather than a hopeful one.

# The desktop package's source: root src/pswamp/, which supplies the PMU
# decoding, time-window storage and monitoring applications this server is a
# front end for. It lands at ${REPO_DIR}/src, exactly where the manifest's
# "../../" resolves to from the server directory -- see the workspace note at the
# top of this stage.
#
# Only src/ is copied, not the whole repo: examples/, tests/ and build/ are
# excluded in .dockerignore, so they never reach the daemon in the first place.
#
# Copied after the dependency install so editing src/pswamp/ does not invalidate
# the layer holding every third-party wheel; only the few seconds of --no-deps
# below re-run. --no-deps is safe precisely because those dependencies were
# installed above, and asserts it: were the root manifest to gain a dependency
# without app/server-python/uv.lock being refreshed, this would fail at import
# rather than silently resolving.
#
# Editable, so the copied source is the live import path and `docker compose
# watch` can sync edits to root src/pswamp/ into a running container for uvicorn
# --reload to pick up — the same loop the server's own src/ already has. Nothing
# is published from here, so an editable install in the image costs nothing.

# new app package — needs no Dockerfile edit.

# excluding synchrophasor above a checked decision. Importing is side-effect
# free: the server only binds a port under __main__.
