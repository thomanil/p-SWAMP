For the shorter tour of the whole rig, of which this api is one part, read
`client-server-rig.md`.

The shape of the api
==

**Two directions, two transports.** A user action goes up as an HTTP `POST` under
`/api/<app>/`. The server pushes everything it has to say back down a WebSocket at
`/api/<app>/ws` (the websocket never carries anything upstream). A command answers with a
small acknowledgement, never with state — so state travels exactly one path, and a
client never reconciles the order of two.

```
   BROWSER                                   SERVER (one process, one event loop)

   page component                            FastAPI app  (src/server.py)
        │  onClick                                │
        ▼                                         │  routers mounted per app
   page hook  (useReferenceSubappSocket)          │  under /api/<app>
        │                                         │
        ├──► postCommand() ──── POST ─────────────┼──► command endpoint
        │    lib/commands.ts   ?client_id=…       │      mutates that client's state
        │                      ◄── CommandAck ────┤      then pushes ↓
        │                                         │
        └──► useServerSocket() ◄══ WS frames ═════┴──◄ push task / SocketRegistry
             hooks/useServerSocket.ts   {type:"state",…}
```

Both resolve against **the origin that served the page**. The client offers no
backend picker; dev imitates production rather than taking a special path.


Where the contract comes from
==

**The Python is the source; everything else is generated.** Ordinary server code
defines the api — each app package's `router` (its paths, `operation_id`s, body
models and `CommandAck` replies) and the `WS_MESSAGE` model it pushes down its
socket. `api_contract.py` defines nothing: it describes and assembles the
document, and adds the socket half OpenAPI has no notion of.

```
   src/<app>/  and  src/pswamp_web/<app>/        ← THE DEFINITION. Edit here.
     router       POST paths, operation_id, body models, CommandAck
     WS_MESSAGE   the pydantic model this package pushes
        │
        ▼
   src/api_contract.py                            ← metadata + the socket half
     title, API_VERSION, description, tag text
     walks APPS for WS_MESSAGE → components.schemas + x-websocket-channels
     install() overrides app.openapi()
        │
        ▼
   tools/dump_openapi.py       imports `server`, asks it for its own document
        │
        ▼
   doc/api/openapi.json        generated, committed — and served live at
        │                      /openapi.json, /docs, /redoc
        │  openapi-typescript
        ▼
   app/client-web/src/api/schema.ts               generated, committed
        │
        ├──► src/api/wire.ts      →  Wire['ReferenceSubappState'] in each hook
        └──► src/lib/commands.ts  →  postCommand, typed against the paths
```

Two consequences follow, and they are the whole point of pointing it this way:

- **Never edit the two generated files.** Put the change in the Python — a route,
  a model, or the metadata in `api_contract.py` — then run
  `./scripts/generate-api-contract.sh`, then commit all of it together. Hand-edit
  `openapi.json` or `schema.ts` and the next regeneration discards your work
  without a word. See [Changing the api](#changing-the-api).
- **The committed contract cannot disagree with the running server**, because
  `dump_openapi.py` imports the app and asks it for its own document instead of
  describing the api a second time. `generate-api-contract.sh --check` regenerates
  into a temp dir and diffs the result; `error_check.sh` runs that on every push.

For the file-by-file table, see [Where the pieces live](#where-the-pieces-live).


Common tasks
==

Recipes for what people actually come here to do.

### I want to add a command (a new POST) to an existing app

Write it in that app's `api.py`. Give every operation its own url; never build one
endpoint that takes an action name:

```python
@router.post("/count/step", operation_id="reference_subapp_step")
async def step(client_id: ClientId) -> CommandAck:
    """One line saying what it does — this becomes the description in /docs."""
    ...
```

- **Always set `operation_id`, as `<app>_<verb>`** with the app in snake_case
  (`time_window_resync`, `reference_subapp_bump`). A generated client calls that
  name, so you choose it deliberately rather than deriving it — renaming the
  handler must never rename someone's generated method.
- **Import `ClientId` and `CommandAck`** from `shared` in a standalone app, or
  from `..wire` inside `pswamp_web/`, which may not import the rest of the backend.
- **Taking a body?** Declare a pydantic model in the same file and take it as a
  parameter — `body: ChannelSelection`. FastAPI then rejects a malformed command
  with a 422 before your handler runs.
- **Never return the new state.** `CommandAck` only; state goes down the socket.

Client side, one call. `tsc` checks the path against the contract, so a typo fails
the build:

```ts
const step = useCallback(
  () => fire(postCommand(`${REFERENCE_SUBAPP_API_PATH}/count/step`)),
  [],
)
```

Then run `./scripts/generate-api-contract.sh` and commit `doc/api/openapi.json`
and `app/client-web/src/api/schema.ts` along with the code.

### I want to add a field to a socket message

Add it to the message model — `pswamp_web/wire.py` for the p-SWAMP apps, the app's
own `api.py` for a standalone one — and fill it in wherever `state_message()` (or
the page's push task) builds it.

Run `./scripts/generate-api-contract.sh` and `Wire['<Model>']` carries the field
— and so does the page, which reads the message as the contract types it. There
is deliberately no mapping layer to extend: hooks used to rename every field into
a camelCase mirror, which meant a new field reached the page only if someone
remembered to add it there too, and a `useMemo` that forgot one type-checks
perfectly. Render it and you are done.

Commit `doc/api/openapi.json` and `app/client-web/src/api/schema.ts` with the
model change.

### I want to add a whole new page and its api

```
./scripts/generate-new-subapp.sh flow-map "Flow Map"
```

The script writes both halves, patches the four registries, regenerates the
contract and runs the checks. The new app joins the contract with **no registry
entry to add** — see "How a package joins the contract" below. It has already run
`./scripts/generate-api-contract.sh` for you, so commit `doc/api/openapi.json`
and `app/client-web/src/api/schema.ts` along with the new folders.

> **To see every moving part a subapp needs, run that script and read the diff.**
> It is a more complete answer than any list here: it writes a page folder under
> `app/client-web/src/pages/<slug>/` and a backend package under
> `app/server-python/src/<pkg>/` — socket endpoint, pydantic models, two POST
> commands over a per-client counter, the hook and the view — patches the four
> registries (`server.py`, `lib/servers.ts`, `App.tsx`, `AppLayout.tsx`), and
> regenerates the contract so both artifacts match the new code. Run it on a
> throwaway name purely to look: `git status` shows exactly what it touched, and
> deleting the two new folders plus reverting the four patched files undoes it.

### I want to add a plain GET (something static, not pushed)

Same as a command, but **declare a response model**. A bare `-> dict` publishes as
an untyped `object`, which leaves the client casting an implicitly-`any` body:

```python
@router.get("/channels", operation_id="time_window_channels")
async def list_channels() -> ChannelCatalogue:
    return ChannelCatalogue(channels=_channels())
```

Use a GET only for what never changes (the grid topology, the channel catalogue).
Put anything that changes on the socket.

Then run `./scripts/generate-api-contract.sh` and commit `doc/api/openapi.json`
and `app/client-web/src/api/schema.ts` along with the endpoint.

### `error_check.sh` is failing on "api contract (spec matches code)"

You changed the api and left the committed contract behind. The check prints the
diff:

```
./scripts/generate-api-contract.sh      # regenerate both artifacts
```

then commit `doc/api/openapi.json` and `app/client-web/src/api/schema.ts` with your
change. Hand-edit nothing — that is the whole fix.

### How do I see what the api looks like right now?

Run a server and open `/docs` (Swagger UI, grouped by app) or `/redoc`. Without
one, query the committed file:

```
jq '.paths | keys' doc/api/openapi.json                  # every HTTP operation
jq '.["x-websocket-channels"]' doc/api/openapi.json      # every socket channel
jq '.components.schemas | keys' doc/api/openapi.json     # every model
```

### I renamed a field. Is that a breaking change?

Yes. Anyone generating against the contract sees a rename as a removal plus an
addition. Bump `API_VERSION`, run `./scripts/generate-api-contract.sh`, commit
`doc/api/openapi.json` and `app/client-web/src/api/schema.ts` with the change, and
say so in the pull request. An added optional field breaks nothing and needs no
bump. See "Versioning" below.

### Do I need to regenerate after changing only a docstring?

Yes. Docstrings become operation descriptions, so they land in the generated
artifacts and the check catches them. Run `./scripts/generate-api-contract.sh` and
commit `doc/api/openapi.json` and `app/client-web/src/api/schema.ts`, exactly as
for any other api change.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*The rest is reference: what the contract guarantees, then how the two transports
work underneath it.*


What the contract is
==

**`doc/api/openapi.json`** — an OpenAPI 3.1 document, generated from the server
and committed. It describes:

- **every command**, as an HTTP `POST` operation with a stable `operationId`, its
  path and query parameters, its request body and its `CommandAck` reply;
- **the two plain GETs** — the grid topology and the channel catalogue;
- **`GET /healthz`**;
- **every WebSocket message**, as a schema under `components.schemas`, with the
  channels themselves listed under the `x-websocket-channels` extension.

**`app/client-web/src/api/schema.ts`** — TypeScript generated from that document
by `openapi-typescript`, also committed. The web client reads it through
`src/api/wire.ts`, the small hand-written layer over it.

The running server serves the identical document at **`/openapi.json`**, and
**`/docs`** (Swagger UI) and **`/redoc`** render it. One function produces both the
served and the committed copy, so the two cannot disagree — and
`scripts/error_check.sh` proves it on every push.

> Swagger UI at `/docs` fetches its own assets from a CDN, so the browser needs
> internet. `/openapi.json` and `/redoc`'s data do not.


Which subapp a request belongs to
==

The contract follows the code's own organisation. Every operation carries its
app's url name as a tag — `reference-subapp`, `time-window`, `islanding` — and
that name
is the `/api/<app>` segment, the server package name with underscores, and the web
client's page folder. So `/api/time-window/selection` lives in `time_window/` on
the server and `pages/grid-monitor/time-window/` in the client, and Swagger UI
groups it under `time-window`. One name, four places, no lookup table.

`operationId` follows the same rule: `<app>_<verb>`, e.g. `time_window_resync`,
`islanding_acknowledge`. A generated client calls those names, so we choose them
deliberately rather than deriving them — renaming a handler must not rename
someone's generated method.


How a package joins the contract
==

**A package joins by exporting a name.** No registry to add an entry to.

`server.py` already discovers optional package features with
`getattr(module, "lifespan", None)`. Socket messages work identically — a package
exports the model it pushes:

```python
# app/server-python/src/reference_subapp/__init__.py
from .api import ReferenceSubappState, router

WS_MESSAGE = ReferenceSubappState

__all__ = ["WS_MESSAGE", "ReferenceSubappState", "router"]
```

An app that also needs startup/shutdown work exports a `lifespan` beside those —
`pmu_test_streamer` (a playback ticker) and `pswamp_web` (the pipeline registry)
are the two that do.

`api_contract.py` walks the same `APPS` list `server.py` mounts and collects
whatever each package exports under that name. An app with no socket
(`pswamp_web/grid/`, which is HTTP only) simply omits it.

This is why `scripts/generate-new-subapp.sh` needed no new anchor to patch: its
template exports `WS_MESSAGE`, so a scaffolded subapp joins the contract the
moment the script writes it. The script regenerates both artifacts before it runs
the checks — commit them along with the rest.

One rule keeps this working: **push a pydantic model, never a bare dict.** A bare
dict drops the app out of the contract silently — the page keeps working, the type
safety disappears, and nothing says so. Every push therefore goes through
`wire.send_state`, which takes a `BaseModel` — the one serialiser in the backend,
and the reason a bare `NaN` (which `JSON.parse` rejects) can never reach the
wire. `SocketRegistry.send_to_client` is that same call, fanned out to whatever
sockets one client has open.


Changing the api
==

1. Change the Python — an endpoint, a body model, or a message model.
2. Run `./scripts/generate-api-contract.sh`.
3. Commit `doc/api/openapi.json` and `app/client-web/src/api/schema.ts` with the
   change.

Skip step 2 and `./scripts/error_check.sh` fails — locally in the pre-push hook,
then again in CI — printing a diff of what moved. We want that: committing the
contract only buys a **reviewable** change if it rides in the same pull request as
the code that caused it.

Never hand-edit either generated file. `schema.ts` says so at the top, and the
next regeneration overwrites you.

### Versioning

Bump `API_VERSION` in `app/server-python/src/api_contract.py` **by hand, on a
breaking change** — a removed or renamed field, a removed operation, a narrowed
type. Additive changes need nothing.

We left it manual on purpose. A version that moves on every commit tells a reader
nothing; one that moves only when compatibility breaks becomes the single line in
a diff that says "coordinate this one". If you bump it, say so in the pull
request — see "The api contract" in `how-we-work-together.md`.


Addressing: origin, prefix, client id
==

Three things decide where a request goes and whose state it touches.
`app/client-web/src/lib/` settles all three.

**Origin** — `servers.ts` builds every url from `window.location`:

| helper | produces | used by |
|---|---|---|
| `resolveServerUrl(wsPath)` | `ws(s)://<host><BASE_PATH><path>` | the one WebSocket, in `useServerSocket` |
| `resolveApiUrl(path)` | `http(s)://<host><BASE_PATH><path>` | `postCommand`, and the two plain GETs |

The protocol follows the page's (`https:` → `wss:`), so no code has to know
whether it runs behind TLS.

**Prefix** — `basePath.ts` discovers the mount prefix at runtime: it reads its own
`import.meta.url` and cuts at `/assets/`. Remotely the app sits under `/p-swamp/`
behind a reverse proxy that strips the prefix before forwarding, so the *server*
sees plain `/api/...` and the *browser* has to put it back. That is how one
published image runs both at a root and under a prefix. It depends on routes
staying one segment deep — that file explains why.

**Client id** — `clientId.ts` resolves one random integer per browser profile,
persists it in `localStorage`, and every socket and every command sends it:

- sockets as `?client_id=` on the WebSocket url (`useServerSocket`),
- commands as `?client_id=` on the POST (`postCommand` attaches it, so no caller
  passes it).

That id shards all server state. One id per browser is what makes the grid
monitor's five sockets show **one** server-side pipeline rather than five. It
authenticates **nothing** and pretends to nothing: send someone else's id and you
drive their replay.

The same urls work in dev because Vite proxies the whole `/api` prefix —
WebSocket upgrades included — to the backend on `:8000` (`server.proxy` in
`vite.config.ts`). In the shipped image the server serves the client itself, so
every request is same-origin by construction.


Downstream: how state reaches the screen
==

Client side
--

`useServerSocket(wsPath, options)` (`src/hooks/useServerSocket.ts`) handles the
whole connection half for every app. It:

1. opens one WebSocket to `resolveServerUrl(wsPath) + '?client_id=' + CLIENT_ID`;
2. reconnects every 2 s while down — **except** after close codes `1008` (id
   rejected) and `1013` (server at pipeline capacity). The server meant those
   refusals, and retrying only makes them worse;
3. runs each frame through `JSON.parse`, drops anything whose `type` is not
   `"state"`, then either stores it (`message`) or hands it to `options.onMessage`;
4. tracks a `status` — `connecting` / `online` / `offline` — which separates
   "never reached the server" from "an established connection dropped".

It knows nothing about message *shape*. Each page's own hook types the payload
with the generated `Wire['<Model>']` and hands it on as-is — snake_case field
names included, because those come from the contract and are checked against it.
A hook may still *derive* something (`useLineOutageSocket` parses branch names
out of the channel labels, `useTimeWindowSocket` accumulates a ring buffer); what
it no longer does is rename.

**Reach for the `onMessage` escape hatch when the stream is fast.** Storing a
message in React state costs a render pass — right for a small payload drawn as
SVG (phasors, islanding), wrong for a 50 Hz sample stream. `useTimeWindowSocket`
therefore keeps its samples in a `useRef` and notifies the chart through its own
`subscribe`, so ten messages a second trigger zero renders. React re-renders only
when something it owns changes: the channel list, or the connection status.

Server side
--

`src/server.py` does wiring and nothing else. It mounts each app package's
`router` under its prefix from `APPS`, tags it with the app's url slug, composes
every package's `lifespan` into one, serves `/healthz`, and mounts the built
client at `/` last — a mount at `/` is greedy and swallows anything registered
after it.

From there the two families of app part ways.

**The scaffold demos** keep it minimal. `reference_subapp/` is the whole of it:

- `states: dict[str, ReferenceSubappModel]` — the entire store, keyed by client
  id;
- `SocketRegistry` (`src/shared.py`) — client id → this client's live sockets,
  pure transport, one instance per app. It is `SessionRegistry` (see
  `pswamp_web/sessions.py`) with the socket itself as the session, which is the
  same structure the page packages register their view state in;
- a command handler that mutates one client's state and pushes it, and a socket
  handler that pushes on connect and then only waits.

`pmu_test_streamer/` (the older demo, on its way out) adds the one thing the
reference app has no need of: a `ticker()` task, which the package's `lifespan`
starts, advancing every playing client each tick and sending each its own
`state_message()`. Copy that pair when an app has to push on its own clock rather
than only in response to a command.

A client id may briefly hold several sockets — a reconnect overlapping the dying
one — which is why it is a set. `send_to_client` iterates a snapshot and drops any
socket that fails mid-send, so one dead connection cannot break delivery to the
rest.

**The p-SWAMP layer** (`src/pswamp_web/`) is the real one, with a pipeline behind
it. Every endpoint opens the same way:

```python
async with connected_hub(ws) as hub:
    if hub is None:
        return
```

`connected_hub` (`pswamp_web/hub.py`) parses `?client_id=`, accepts the socket,
and holds that client's `Hub` for the life of the connection. It refuses in two
different orders, deliberately. Given **no usable id** it closes *before*
accepting, rejecting the handshake outright. **At capacity** it accepts *first*
and then closes with `1013`, because a close code only reaches the browser over an
established connection — and the client treats `1013` as terminal.

A `Hub` holds one client's pipeline: a `RecordingPlayer` over the committed Nordic
44 recording, three p-SWAMP monitoring applications each with their own reader off
that player, and the alarm/status/island stores. Only `HubRegistry` constructs
one, and it enforces three rules: one pipeline per client however many sockets (a
per-client lock, so the monitor's five simultaneous first-connects build one
rather than racing to build five); a pipeline outlives its sockets by
`IDLE_EVICT_SECONDS`, so a reload rejoins the same stream; and never more than
`MAX_PIPELINES`.

Then each page picks one of **two delivery patterns**:

| pattern | apps | how it works |
|---|---|---|
| **Poll the window** | `time_window` (10 Hz), `phasors` (5 Hz), `app_status` (2 Hz) | an `asyncio` task reads the client's window or stores on its own timer and sends |
| **Subscribe to the bus** | `islanding`, `line_outage` | a listener on `hub.bus` offers into an `asyncio.Queue`; the push task blocks on that queue |

Polling translates directly from what the Qt widgets do, and it keeps a 50 Hz
sample stream from becoming 50 event-loop callbacks a second. Subscribing suits
results and events, which arrive about once a second or less.

Both bus-driven pages re-read the payload from the hub rather than carrying it on
the queue, so a dropped notification costs latency and never content.

Every page sends through **`send_state()`** (`pswamp_web/wire.py`), never
`ws.send_json`:

```python
await ws.send_text(message.model_dump_json())
```

`json.dumps` emits bare `NaN` and `Infinity` tokens and `JSON.parse` rejects them
outright — and NaN is the *normal* case here, since a `TimeWindow` holds nothing
else until it fills. Routing every page through one function stops a new message
type from quietly reintroducing it. A missing measurement therefore reaches the
client as `null`, never `NaN` — the models declare `float | None` and the server
substitutes — and a `TimeWindow` arrives all-`null` until it fills, which is
normal and not an error. The pydantic models in `wire.py` are the
schema the Qt front end never needed: its widgets read the very `TimeWindow`
object the application thread writes into.

The thread seam
--

p-SWAMP's monitoring applications are upstream code, and they run as plain daemon
threads looping on a blocking read. We leave that exactly as it is. They cross
into the event loop at **exactly two places**:

1. **`Bus.publish_threadsafe()`** (`pswamp_web/bus.py`) → `loop.call_soon_threadsafe`
   → `_deliver` on the loop → synchronous listeners (the stores) and queued
   subscriptions (the pages). The bus is **per pipeline**, so a listener only ever
   hears its own client's results.
2. **`CountingTimeWindowLabeled.snapshot()`** (`pswamp_web/replay.py`) — reads the
   append counter *and* the data under the window's own lock, so the two describe
   the same instant.

Everything else — WS handlers, push tasks, request handlers — runs cooperatively
scheduled on the one loop and never truly parallel, so none of it needs a lock.
Add a third seam and that stops being reviewable.

The delta protocol
--

`time_window` is the one page where the naive approach fails. A 30 s window of 8
channels at 50 Hz holds 12,000 numbers, and re-sending it 10×/s costs roughly a
megabyte per second per client. So it sends the window once (`mode: "full"`) and
afterwards only the rows that are new (`mode: "append"`) — measured at ~5.9 KB/s
against ~1.4 MB/s.

The counter on the window makes that possible: `new_rows = appended -
state.last_appended`. Two cases force a full message instead: a fresh selection,
where the client's traces belong to different channels entirely; and a client that
has fallen behind by more than the window, where an append would splice unrelated
data onto what it already holds.


Upstream: how a command reaches the server
==

Client side
--

A page hook exposes one named function per operation, each wrapping `postCommand`
from `src/lib/commands.ts`:

```ts
const bump = useCallback(
  () => fire(postCommand(`${REFERENCE_SUBAPP_API_PATH}/count/bump`)),
  [],
)
```

`postCommand(path, options?)` is the only code that sends anything upstream. It
fills in any `{placeholder}` in the path from `options.path` (url-encoding each
value), resolves the url, appends `?client_id=`, sets `Content-Type` only when it
carries a body, and throws a `CommandError` with the status and FastAPI's `detail`
on any non-2xx. The contract types both the path and the body, so a typo fails
`tsc` instead of returning a 404 — see "Changing the api" above.

Callers log and carry on (`fire` in each hook). The UI treats a command as
fire-and-forget: the resulting state arrives on the socket or not at all, so a
failed command changes nothing — which is what the user already sees. Keep
controls `disabled={!connected}` for the same reason: without a socket the POST
still reaches the server, but its result has nowhere to land.

Server side
--

Every command endpoint declares its caller and its reply the same way:

```python
@router.post("/count/bump", operation_id="reference_subapp_bump")
async def bump(client_id: ClientId) -> CommandAck:
    ...
```

- **`ClientId`** — an annotated query parameter, so FastAPI validates it before
  any handler runs; missing or non-numeric returns a 422.
- **`CommandAck`** — `{status, applied}`. Deliberately not the new state.
- **`operation_id`** — an explicit, readable name per operation.
- Bodies are pydantic models (`ChannelSelection`, `AlarmNote`), so a malformed command returns a 422 instead of crashing a
  handler.

`shared.py` holds `ClientId` and `CommandAck` for the scaffold apps.
`pswamp_web/wire.py` keeps deliberate **twins** of both, because that package may
not import the rest of the web backend — we wrote it to move into the desktop
package as `pswamp/web/`. Change one pair, change the other.

Both `ClientId`s are a `str` matching `^\d{1,20}$`, the exact rule
`read_client_id` applies to a socket's query parameter in both `shared.py` and
`pswamp_web/hub.py`. They have to agree, or a page's commands address different
state from its sockets. They once did not: `shared.py` used an `int` with `ge=1`
while `wire.py` used this pattern, which published two schemas for one identity
and disagreed about `"0"`.

Every handler then does two things: change the right state, and get that change
onto the screen. The state lives in three different places, so there are three
arrangements.

**1. State in a module dict** — `reference_subapp`, `pmu_test_streamer`, and
anything the scaffold generates. The simplest case, and it needs no new plumbing:
`SocketRegistry` already addresses a client id and already runs on this same
event loop.

```
POST /api/reference-subapp/count/bump?client_id=42
  → get_state("42").bump()
  → logger.info("client %s: %s …", "42", "bump")
  → manager.send_to_client("42", state_message(model))   ← the push, from an HTTP handler
  → 200 CommandAck(applied="bump")
```

**2. State in the client's pipeline** — `islanding`. A client id reaches the hub,
but not the *push task*, which sits blocked on its queue inside a socket handler.
So the endpoint mutates and then wakes it:

```
POST /api/islanding/alarms/<uuid>/acknowledge?client_id=42
  → live_hub("42")                       ← 404 if this client has no pipeline
  → hub.alarms.annotate(uuid, …)         ← False for an unknown alarm → 404
  → _nudge("42")  → _offer(queue, None) for each of this client's open views
  → push task wakes, re-reads the hub, send_state()
  → 200 CommandAck(applied="acknowledge")
```

An operator action changes the alarm list, and no application publishes an event
for that. Without the nudge, the page would show the change only when the
islanding detector next produced a result — up to a second later. Measured round
trip with it: ~1 ms.

**3. State on the connection itself** — `time_window`. A view's channel selection
is per-*connection*, living in a local variable inside the socket handler, and a
command arrives on no connection at all. `SessionRegistry`
(`pswamp_web/sessions.py`) fixes that: the handler publishes its `ClientState` for
the life of the socket, and the command finds it by client id.

```
POST /api/time-window/selection?client_id=42   {"channels": [5, 9]}
  → live_hub("42")
  → channels.sanitise(body.channels, tw.n_cols)   ← untrusted input, clamped
  → for each of this client's open views: selection = …, needs_full = True
  → 200 CommandAck(applied="select_channels (2)")
  → …no push here. The 10 Hz task sees needs_full on its next tick and sends
    the mode:"full" message by itself.
```

A client may hold several sessions for one endpoint — two tabs — so a command
applies to all of them: one browser is one viewer, and its views should agree. The
registry stores them in a **list**, not a set, because these are `eq=True`
dataclasses and Python makes those unhashable.

Two rules that hold across all three
--

- **A command never builds a pipeline.** `live_hub(client_id)` peeks; it never
  calls `REGISTRY.acquire`. Acquiring would spend four threads and ~30 MB against
  `MAX_PIPELINES` on a replay nobody is watching, and the POST has no socket to
  deliver results to. No pipeline means a 404 — in practice, "you have no page
  open".
- **A socket that receives nothing still needs its receive loop.** Every WS
  handler ends in `while True: await ws.receive_text()`. Without a pending
  receive, nothing notices a closed socket until the next send, so an idle client
  lingers indefinitely — holding a pipeline slot, in the `pswamp_web` case.


The plain GETs
==

Two endpoints are neither commands nor pushed state, because what they return
never changes: the grid topology (`GET /api/grid/model`) and the channel
catalogue (`GET /api/time-window/channels`). A page fetches each once on mount
via `resolveApiUrl`, and the browser may cache it. Putting them on a socket would
force every consumer's hook to handle a second message shape just to receive
something static.


Error and refusal semantics
==

| condition | how it surfaces |
|---|---|
| missing, empty, negative or non-numeric `client_id`, or more than 20 digits | `422`, from FastAPI validation, before the handler |
| malformed command body | `422`, from the pydantic model |
| unknown sequence name | `422` naming the valid ones |
| unknown alarm uuid | `404` |
| command for a client with no pipeline | `404` |
| command for a client with no open view (`time-window`) | `404` |
| socket with an unusable client id | close `1008`, **before** accept — client stops retrying |
| socket when every pipeline is in use | accept, then close `1013` — client stops retrying |
| unknown path under `/api/` | real `404`, never the SPA shell (`SPAStaticFiles._NO_FALLBACK`) |

The server *accepts* `"0"`, incidentally: the rule reads "numeric and at most 20
digits", not "a positive integer". Nothing generates it — the browser picks a
random positive integer — and it works as a key like any other. It earns a mention
only because an earlier `ge=1` on the scaffold apps rejected it, which left the
two halves disagreeing.

All of which shows the practical difference the two transports make: a rejected
command can say *why*, with a status code, in the access log and in the Network
tab.

Implementation notes
==

**We collapse duplicate schema names.** `CommandAck` exists twice on purpose — in
`shared.py` and in `pswamp_web/wire.py` — and the reason is this repo's central
compromise: **one analysis core, two front ends.** We wrote the p-SWAMP web layer
to move into the desktop package as `pswamp/web/`, a third presentation adapter
beside `gui/` (PySide6) and `visualization/`, so it may import nothing from the
rest of the web backend — `shared.py` included, where the scaffold apps keep their
copy. Two packages that cannot share a module need two declarations of the same
four-line model. The Qt and web front ends pay for their shared core here, rather
than in the core itself.

That cost lands in the published contract, not in the code. Pydantic
disambiguates same-named classes by *module path*, so the reply to all fourteen
commands would otherwise publish as `shared__CommandAck` and
`pswamp_web__wire__CommandAck` — two names for one concept, one of them baking in
a path we have documented as moving, which would rename a schema in every
consumer's generated code the day that move lands. Both classes therefore set
`model_config = ConfigDict(title="CommandAck")`, and `collapse_titled_twins` folds
structurally identical twins back to that title. Twins that genuinely diverge keep
their separate names, which is the right outcome for two different shapes.

**Don't expect this to expire on its own**, and keep straight which half is the
workaround. The *duplication* is the standing compromise; `collapse_titled_twins`
keeps it out of the contract, and consumers depend on that piece. §7 of
`WIP-context-port-from-qt-to-web-frontend.md` decides whether the duplication ever
goes away, and the answer runs opposite to the intuition: if **Qt stays**,
`pswamp_web/` moves *into* the desktop package and still cannot import the web
backend's `shared.py`, so the twin becomes permanent. Only if **Qt goes** and the
two Python projects merge could one `CommandAck` serve everything. Until that is
settled, treat the twin as load-bearing and keep the two in step.

**`openapi-typescript` declares a stale peer.** It wants `typescript@^5.x` while
this project runs 6, though it drives the TS 6 compiler API without complaint (we
checked). So `app/client-web/package.json` carries an `overrides` entry pointing
that peer at the project's own TypeScript, which keeps plain `npm install` and
`npm ci` working with no flags rather than pinning everything to
`--legacy-peer-deps`. It costs one visible thing: `scripts/update-dependencies.sh`
runs `npm-check-updates --peer`, which refuses to bump TypeScript past 5 while the
stale range stands, and says so in its report. Drop the `overrides` entry when
upstream widens the range.
